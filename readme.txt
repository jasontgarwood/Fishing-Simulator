Project Name: Fishing Simulator

Description: Fishing Simulator is an arcade-style game where the
objective is to catch as many high scoring fish as possible. The 
character has immediate control of the line’s depth while fish 
cross under the boat. The challenge arises from the player’s 
limited amount of hooks and the threat of trash or unexpected 
creatures breaking the line. Larger fish will only bite the line
if a smaller fish is on the hook. With the player’s choice to reel 
up the fish or wait for a bigger fish, they risk losing their hook 
for a higher score. When playing beginner or expert mode hooking
 fish requires timing and skill. The game gets progressively more 
difficult to play as the player builds a higher score
